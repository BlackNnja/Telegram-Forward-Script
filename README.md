## Customizing Message Filtering ‚úÇÔ∏è

This section explains how you can customize the message filtering in the Telegram Forwarder Script to suit your needs. You can modify the script to remove specific tags, replace usernames, and filter out messages based on certain criteria.

### 1. Removing Specific Tags (Mentions)

By default, the script removes all tags (mentions) from the messages. You can customize this behavior to exclude specific usernames or tags. Here's how you can modify the filtering settings:

1. **Modify the `FILTER_CONFIG` dictionary**:
   In the script, you will find the `FILTER_CONFIG` dictionary. It allows you to customize the filtering process. To filter out specific usernames or words, update the dictionary as follows:

   ```python
   FILTER_CONFIG = {
       'words': ['spam', 'advertisement'],  # Words to filter out
       'usernames': ['@username1', '@username2'],  # Usernames to filter out
       'links': True  # Set to True to remove URLs from messages
   }
   ```

2. **Filter Words**:
   To remove specific words from messages, add them to the `words` list:
   ```python
   FILTER_CONFIG['words'] = ['unwantedword1', 'unwantedword2']
   ```

3. **Filter Usernames**:
   To remove mentions of specific usernames, add them to the `usernames` list:
   ```python
   FILTER_CONFIG['usernames'] = ['@username1', '@username2']
   ```

4. **Remove Links (URLs)**:
   To remove URLs from the messages, set the `links` value to `True`:
   ```python
   FILTER_CONFIG['links'] = True  # Set this to False to keep links
   ```

### 2. Example of Custom Filter Configuration

```python
FILTER_CONFIG = {
    'words': ['spam', 'advertisement'],    # Words to filter out
    'usernames': ['@user1', '@bot'],        # Usernames to filter out
    'links': True                           # Set to True to remove URLs
}
```

### 3. Where to Apply Filters

The `apply_filters` function in the script is responsible for applying the configured filters to each message before it is forwarded. The filters work as follows:
- **Words**: Filters out unwanted words from the message text.
- **Usernames**: Filters out mentions of specific usernames.
- **Links**: Filters out URLs using regular expressions.
